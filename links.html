		<p>Though it is not very relevant to my career at the moment, I do love hearing about the newest creations using Machine Learning/Artificial Intelligence. I want to, at some point, work on a project such as Leela Chess Zero, which is a chess neural network that is trained by normal internet users, like you and me, on their PCs.<br><br></p>

		<p><a href="https://lczero.org/" target="_blank">https://lczero.org/</a></p>
		<p>As I mentioned above, I really find this project interesting. There is a version Google made, called AlphaZero, which was able to defeat the best chess engine at the time, Stockfish. However, hearing about a company who could easily pour millions into a project like this is not as exciting as the internet coming together to train this chess engine using their own resources. Leela knew no chess strategies at the beginning, and seeing her progress from the point where even a novice could beat her with ease, to beating the best open-source chess engine out, Stockfish, is something many patiently waited for. <br><br></p>

		<p>Out of the projects I've worked on, the two times I've enjoyed myself the most was when I was making a website. However, I imagine I'd enjoy creating software that's useful for everyone more.<br><br></p>

		<p><b><u>Software Development</u></b></p>

		<p>As mentioned above, working on software that would improve user's lives is something that's on my bucket list. My goal is not to create something new, but to improve upon current applications and make them more user friendly. Perhaps an app redesign is a project I could take on soon. <br><br></p>

		<p>Although I love coding, it can get frustrating when you're stuck on a problem for hours and can't find a solution... even after going to StackOverflow. That is when I like to switch projects and work on something related to Electrical Engineering. The first youtube link is me in my freshman year presenting a subtask of our marble sorter. Though horrendus looking back at it, this project was part of the reason I decided to become a Computer Engineer. This project combined elements from Computer Science and Electrical Engineering. The first link is something close to what I have on my resume, but in the physical form. I thought building it using Verilog was a fun project. But for some reason, most people hated it. </p>
