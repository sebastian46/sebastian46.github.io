		<h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
		<!-- <p>Howdy! I'm a senior at Texas A&M University from Houston, TX and majoring in Computer Engineering. I chose Computer Engineering because I was not sure if I liked the hardware or software side of computersâ€”only that I wanted a career where I worked with them closely. I started liking the Computer Science part more of my degree after taking a beginner programming class. I figured out how to make simple programs, which made me excited. Knowing that I had the power to create something that could help others was great. But alas, I only ended up making small programs that served very little use. I did have fun creating them of course. It was not until recently that I started taking a liking to front-end development (Javascript, React, HTML, CSS). I can instantly see what I'm doing, how good it looks, and it allows me to be creative, unlike the electrical engineering side of my degree. </p>
		<br><br>
		<p>As far as non-academics go, I enjoy playing chess and video games in my spare time. I also like to spend time with my pets (cat and a dog). </p>
		<p>Here are some pictures:</p>

			Howdy! I'm a Full-Stack Software Engineer with 2 years of experience mainly using PHP, React and Javascript.
			<br><br>
			My goal as a human is to make the world a better place using technology. 
			Within the next 10 years, I want to be working on AI in the medical sector. 
			The idea is to one day have a bot at every human's disposal that can help diagnose medical issues. 
			I already see 1000s of problems this could lead to, but it is something I want to exist. 
			I believe this could lead to better diagnosis by doctors, leading to faster treatment.
			<br><br>
			Sitting behind a computer screen all day is not good for us. So in my spare time I like to stay active and away from screens. I currently like hiking, axe throwing, and playing chess. I also have a husky named Ichi.
