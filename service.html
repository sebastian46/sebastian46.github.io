		<h1>SERVICE</h1>
		<p>After going through a rough first year of college, I decided to go back to my old high-school and share with the students the mistakes I made during that time such as thinking I know everything and not studying for tests. This is something that the school calls "Grads Give Back", and it allows alumni to come back after the Fall semester and give a short speech and answer any questions from any students looking to go to a college. Students I've talked to also end up going back the following year to share their experiences and some say that they took the advice everyone gave them during the presentation and helped them stay on track. <br><br></p>
		<p>From time to time, I help students from my high school improve their math skills in order to be well prepared for the SAT. This one is not something I do often since I don't live in Houston, but I make myself available through email in case they have any question regarding a problem or studying strategies.<br><br></p>
		<p>I love helping others learn and improve themselves, which is why I do these things. Knowing I've made a difference in someone's life is a great feeling that I hope others get to experience once. </p>
